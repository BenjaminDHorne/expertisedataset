Heuristics for Identifying Experts in Twitter
---------------------------------------------

This is an anonymized dataset used for understanding how users
identified as experts by others use Twitter differently than other
users.

The dataset contains four types of users:

- experts
- friends of experts (users that experts follow)
- mentions (users that experts mention in their messages), and
- medium hashtag (users who use the same hashtags as experts, excluding outliers).

Each of the four domains: Science, Technology, Health and Fitness, and
Business have similar number of users from group. Messages are
collected between September-November 2015.
